## 1 Iroduction to laser cutting

-*Laser cutting* is a technique that uses a high-energy laser beam to cut materials. This method involves focusing the laser on a specific area of the workpiece, heating the material to its melting or vaporization point, and then using gas or airflow to remove the melted or vaporized material, thereby achieving the cutting process. Laser cutting is commonly applied to metals, plastics, wood, glass, and various other materials, offering high precision and quality cutting edges. It's capable of handling complex shapes and finds widespread use in industries such as manufacturing, medical devices, automotive, aerospace, and more.

## 1 Different kind of material which can be manufacture by laser cutter

### 1.1 Metal Materials

-In laser cutting, commonly used metal materials include **steel, aluminum, copper, and various alloys**. Using metal materials for laser cutting has several advantages: firstly, laser cutting provides high precision for metal materials, enabling precise cutting and processing. Secondly, the heat impact on materials during laser cutting is minimal, reducing deformation and heat-affected zones, resulting in higher quality cutting. Additionally, laser cutting can accomplish complex cutting tasks in a shorter time, enhancing production efficiency.


-However, using metal materials for laser cutting also has some drawbacks: firstly, thicker metal sheets may require higher laser power, potentially increasing cutting costs. Secondly, certain special materials or thicker metals might slow down the cutting speed or hinder achieving the desired cutting effect. Finally, the heat and dust generated during laser cutting might necessitate special handling or cleaning to ensure a safe and clean production environment.

-Simple introductions for the following materials：

-**steel**

-Laser cutting of steel plates is a common industrial processing method that achieves steel cutting through melting, vaporization, or fusion. Laser cutting of steel plates offers advantages of high precision and high speed. However, it's important to note that laser cutting steel plates may generate metal fumes and dust, requiring special handling measures to ensure a clean working environment and operator safety.

</div>

-**copper**

-Compared to other materials, laser cutting of copper plates faces some challenges. Copper has high thermal conductivity, requiring a higher-energy laser beam for cutting, and it's prone to thermal influence zone spreading, potentially resulting in less smooth cutting edges. Laser cutting of copper plates demands more precise control to ensure cutting quality and accuracy.

</div>

-**aluminum**

-Compared to other materials, aluminum plates possess certain advantages in laser cutting. Aluminum has good thermal conductivity, making it relatively easy to be heated and cut by lasers, often resulting in smoother cutting edges. Laser cutting of aluminum plates enables high-precision cutting and processing of intricate shapes, suitable for various applications such as aerospace, automotive manufacturing, and construction projects.

### 1.2 Non-metal Materials

-In laser cutting, commonly used non-metal materials include **plastics, wood, leather, rubber, paper, glass, and various composite materials**.Laser cutting provides high precision for non-metal materials, enabling precise cutting and processing.

-However, using non-metal materials for laser cutting also has some drawbacks: Firstly, specific types of non-metal materials may have limitations in their suitability for laser cutting, requiring more detailed parameter adjustments and process control. Secondly, certain non-metal materials may generate smoke or odor during the laser cutting process, necessitating additional emission treatment measures. 

-Simple introductions for the following materials：

-**Acrylic**

Acrylic is a transparent plastic material, also known as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).Acrylic is easy to work with and mold into various shapes through cutting, engraving, bending, etc., without easily breaking.

</div>

-**Wood** 

Wood boards used for laser cutting need to be selected based on wood types suitable for laser processing, such as plywood, oak, birch, and sometimes softwoods like pine or willow.
