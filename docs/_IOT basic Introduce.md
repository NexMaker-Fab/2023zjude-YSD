**IoT (Internet of Things)** is a system of computing devices, machines, and digital machines in relation to each other, with a universally unique identifier (UUID) and the ability to transmit data over a network without the need for person-to-person or person-to-device interaction

The Internet of Things digitizes the real world and has a wide range of applications. The Internet of Things can narrow dispersed data and integrate digital information between things. The application areas of the Internet of Things mainly include the following aspects: transportation and logistics, industrial manufacturing, health care, intelligent environment (home, office, factory), personal and social fields.
