# Source of  inspiration

**Dongqian Lake boasts beautiful lakes and mountains, the vastness of the lake, the colour of the water and the sky, together with the surrounding green hills and waters, form a pleasant natural scenery. The time Ningbo people spend here is often accompanied by walks by the lake and boat trips on the lake, forming deep memories of the natural beauty.**

**Through interesting cultural creations, the history, culture, humanities and other elements of Dongqianhu can be creatively integrated and expressed to help pass on and promote the local cultural heritage.**

**Choosing the lakeside scenery as the theme, the background of the board can show the serene lakes, graceful mountains and rivers, as well as the lakeside beauty of blue sky and white clouds by the Dongqian Lake. By cleverly integrating the elements of Dongqian Lake into the board design, players can not only roam around the scenery of Dongqian Lake in the game, but also feel the unique history and culture of Ningbo and its rich folk customs. Each special board is a small cultural window, allowing people to appreciate the unique charm of this place while having fun.**

# Preliminary idea

**The theme of this board is "Ningbo Dongqianhu Wanderings", and the plan is to design 5-6 special squares, with the background of Dongqianhu's more characteristic scenery and buildings. There will be no change when the pieces move to the normal squares, but there will be change when they move to the special squares.
Use arduino to create an interactive three-dimensional chess board, divided into two parts, one is the horizontal board, the other is the vertical background. Players use pieces to move on the horizontal board, and when the pieces move to the corresponding squares, some changes will happen in the background, which may be glowing, making a certain sound, or something rising up, similar to a three-dimensional book.**
**The selection of a special checkerboard grid is based on a map of the attractions of Dongqian Lake, requiring that the selected attractions be both representative and evenly dispersed around the scenic area.**

**The selection of a special checkerboard grid is based on a map of the attractions of Dongqian Lake, requiring that the selected attractions be both representative and evenly dispersed around the scenic area. Therefore, Tao Gongguan, Ningbo Safari Park, Xiashui Wetland Park, Xiayu Cicada Temple and Hanling Old Street were selected.**
