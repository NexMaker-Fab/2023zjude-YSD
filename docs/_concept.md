# Source of  inspiration

**Beautiful memories are precious emotional connection points in people's lives. They can be memories of loved ones, friends, romantic moments, or special occasions. By recalling these beautiful moments, we can revisit the emotions related to our interpersonal relationships, strengthen family and friendship bonds, and deepen romantic love.**

**Images serve as the carriers of beautiful memories, and sound and scents can also evoke these cherished memories. By engaging all five senses, we can enable people to continue experiencing the sweetness of beautiful memories in the future.**
**Therefore, we want to create an interactive device for preserving beautiful memories.**

# Preliminary idea

**The theme of this board is "Ningbo Dongqianhu Wanderings", and the plan is to design 5-6 special squares, with the background of Dongqianhu's more characteristic scenery and buildings. There will be no change when the pieces move to the normal squares, but there will be change when they move to the special squares.
Use arduino to create an interactive three-dimensional chess board, divided into two parts, one is the horizontal board, the other is the vertical background. Players use pieces to move on the horizontal board, and when the pieces move to the corresponding squares, some changes will happen in the background, which may be glowing, making a certain sound, or something rising up, similar to a three-dimensional book.**
