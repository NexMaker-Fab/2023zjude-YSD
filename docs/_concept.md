# Source of  inspiration

**Beautiful memories are precious emotional connection points in people's lives. They can be memories of loved ones, friends, romantic moments, or special occasions. By recalling these beautiful moments, we can revisit the emotions related to our interpersonal relationships, strengthen family and friendship bonds, and deepen romantic love.**

**Images serve as the carriers of beautiful memories, and sound and scents can also evoke these cherished memories. By engaging all five senses, we can enable people to continue experiencing the sweetness of beautiful memories in the future.**
**Therefore, we want to create an interactive device for preserving beautiful memories.**

**Using photos as the carriers of cherished memories, incorporating a recording module to capture present-day stories, and adding various scents, the recollection experience is enhanced. In the future, memories can be recalled along with the gentle release of scents. By equipping photos with recording modules and a playback device, designed with the appearance of a vinyl record, the recorded stories can be played back. This concept combines multiple senses to evoke beautiful memories.**

**The integration of photos, recordings, and scents offers a more comprehensive recollection experience, enabling individuals to deeply connect with those precious moments. The design of the recording player, resembling a vinyl record, adds a nostalgic ambiance, allowing people to immerse themselves in reliving the joyful times of the past. This product design holds the potential to become a cherished memory keepsake, helping people better preserve and share their treasured moments.**
